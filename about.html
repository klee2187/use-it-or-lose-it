            About Us: Making Food Storage Simple and Sustainable
        </h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our food storage tracker! We are <b>Jacquelyn 
            and Kristen</b>, the creators behind this tool, and we're 
            passionate about helping you prepare for the future while 
            reducing food waste today.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Story & Mission</h3>
        <p>
            As students at <b>Brigham Young University-Idaho</b> and members 
            of <b>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</b>, we grew 
            up learning the vital importance of self-reliance and having 
            a well-stocked food storage. However, we realized that 
            building and maintaining an effective food supply can 
            often feel overwhelming, confusing, and can even lead to 
            more waste if not tracked properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's why we created this tracker—to make preparing for 
            the future <b>easier, more organized, and accessible for everyone.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>What We Offer</h3>
        <p>

            management. Our comprehensive tracker provides:
